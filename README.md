# Springboard-Meme-Generator
This simple app will take the input from a form and generate a meme with a top and bottom text.

The requirements are as follows:
- The HTML page shows a form with three input options - Top Text, Bottom Text, Image - and a submit button
- Users should be able to submit a form on the page to generate a new meme on the page
- Users should be able to submit a form on the page to generate a new meme on the page
- Users should be able to click on a button to delete/remove a meme from the page
- The form boxes should clear out automatically after the submit is clicked
- The form fields need to have validation so they will not submit if a field is missing
- Be sure to style your meme generator! It should be functional but also look nice

The app was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

TODO:
- work on styling
- deploy
